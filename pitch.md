### Project Pitch: Hotel Menu Application

#### The Basic Story of Your Application
Our Hotel Menu Application aims to provide a seamless and interactive dining experience for hotel guests. The application allows users to browse the hotel's menu, view detailed information about each dish, and make special food orders. The goal is to enhance guest satisfaction by making the menu easily accessible and allowing customization through special orders.

#### The Core Features of Your MVP
1. **Menu Display**: Users can view a list of available dishes categorized into appetizers, main courses, and desserts.
2. **Dish Details**: Clicking on a menu item displays detailed information about the dish, including name, category, ingredients, price (converted to Kenyan Shillings), and an image.
3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific dishes by name using a search input field.
4. **Special Orders**: Users can make special orders by providing a dish name, category, and ingredients through a form.
5. **Responsive Design**: The application will be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

#### The API Data You'll Be Using and How You'll Use It
- **Menu Data**: Sourced from a `db.json` file using `json-server`, which contains an array of menu objects. Each object includes attributes such as `id`, `name`, `category`, `ingredients`, `price`, and `image`.
  - **Usage**: This data is used to display the menu items, provide detailed dish information upon clicking, and filter menu items based on user search input.
- **Special Orders Data**: Also handled through the `db.json` file, where special orders submitted by users are stored with attributes such as `name`, `category`, and `ingredients`.
  - **Usage**: This data is used to submit and store custom dish orders made by users.

#### Challenges You Expect to Face
1. **Handling Asynchronous Data**: Ensuring smooth and efficient data fetching and handling, especially with multiple asynchronous requests.
2. **User Input Validation**: Implementing robust validation for special order submissions to ensure data integrity and user-friendly error messages.
3. **Dynamic UI Updates**: Efficiently updating the UI to reflect changes based on user interactions without page reloads.
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the application works consistently across different web browsers.
5. **Data Synchronization**: Keeping the client-side UI in sync with the data stored in the `json-server`.

#### How You Are Meeting the Requirements of the Project
1. **Single Page Application**: The entire app runs on a single HTML page with dynamic content updates handled through JavaScript.
2. **Event Listeners**: Implemented distinct event listeners including `DOMContentLoaded`, `click` events for menu items, `input` events for search functionality, and `submit` events for form handling.
3. **Asynchronous Data Handling**: All API interactions are handled asynchronously using `fetch` and JSON.
4. **Array Iteration**: Utilized array methods like `forEach` for displaying menu items and `filter` for search functionality.
5. **DRY Principle**: Structured the code into reusable functions to avoid repetition and enhance maintainability.
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application layout is responsive and user-friendly across various devices.

With these features and implementation strategies, our Hotel Menu Application aims to provide an intuitive and efficient solution for hotel guests to explore and personalize their dining experience.
